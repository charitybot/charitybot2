# charitybot2

## Aim

Charitybot started as a means to enable twitch streamers to focus on entertaining their audience during charity streams.
A common scene during charity streams was a streamer who would ask if a donation had been received, pause the game and
navigate to the donation website to confirm. This would very often break up the pacing of the broadcast which could
alienate viewers.

Instead of doing this manually, charitybot takes care of checking the donation amount on the fundraising website and
updating the amount raised automatically on the stream overlay and posting a notice in the twitch chat, helping the
charity streamer focus on what they do best: entertaining viewers in aid of a good cause.

## Upcoming features

- New donation CSS animation on reload
